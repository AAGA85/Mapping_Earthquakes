# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Summary
I have gotten a new position, Data Visualization for the Disaster Reporting Network. The mission of this company is providing data driven storytelling on disasters around the world. 
 
 The objective of this project is to create visualizations with interactive features on earthquakes from around the world. During the development of this challenge, we will need to incorporate the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website. The project also includes the traversing and retrieving earthquake data using JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries and plot the data on a Mapbox map through and API request.
 
 Our map includes:
 - Magnitude (using circles with different diameters and colors to show this magnitude) and location of each earthquake (using a popup marker)
 - Tectonic plates illustration to show the relationship between the location and frequency of seismic activity 

Bonus:
- Additional map style (Dark) designed to provide geographic context while highlighting the data on our  data visualization and  data overlay.


Deliverable 1 and 2: The map can show the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth.
